# Solution
If `if` is not a special form and defined as the book stated as `new-if`, recursion call never ends.

Since scheme follows applicative order, when we calculate not-special-form `new-if`, we should calculate all the parameters it gotten. So it will call `sqrt-iter` again.

In this second call, it meets `new-if` again and this calls `sqrt-iter` again. And this `sqrt-iter` calls `new-if` and so on and on.

Therefore, the `if` should be treated as a special form so that we have the ability not to call the function itself while in its calulation. Because at the base-case in the recursion, it should stop calling itself more and return the specific value.
