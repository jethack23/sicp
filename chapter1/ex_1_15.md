## Code I used to check
```scheme
#lang sicp

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x)
  (display "launched")
  (newline)
  (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)

  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

(sine 12.15)

(define (how-many x)
  (define (iter x cnt)
    (if (< x 0.1)
        cnt
        (iter (/ x 3) (+ cnt 1))))
  (iter x 0))

(how-many 12.15)
```
## Description
I've added "launched" print line in procedure `p`. When I executed `(sine 12.15)`, it appears 5 times.   
In addition, I wrote new procedure to directly calculate how many times the procedure `p` applied, namely, `how-many`. It returns 5 as result.   
Two methods agrees with each other. So the answer is $5$   
We now check the number has the order of growth of $\Theta(\log n)$. Since the number increases 1 whenever the input increases 3 times larger.

# b
Both of the space and the number of steps are proportional to the number of call of the procedure `p`. In the `a`, we checked the number of call has the order of growth $\Theta(\log n)$. So the answer is $\Theta(\log n)$
