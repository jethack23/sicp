# Applicative-order evaluation
## step 1
```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```
## step 2
```scheme
(test 0 ((p)))
```
## step 3
```scheme
(test 0 (((p))))
```
## step n
```scheme
(test 0 {n-of-(}p{n-of-)})
```
It goes forever since in applicative-order evaluation, the value of all operands calculated first. So nothing can be observed.

# Normal-order evaluation
## step 1
```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```
## step 2
```scheme
(if (= 0 0)
    0
    (p))
```
## step 3
```scheme
0
```
Since assumption given about special form `if`, `(p)` doesn't need to be evaluated. So Ben will observe `0` as evaluated result.
