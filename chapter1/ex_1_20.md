# Normal Order

```scheme
(gcd 206 40)

(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))

;; In if clause, (remainder 206 40) have been evaluated. 1 this step, 1 total
(gcd (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))

;; in if clause, (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) have been evaluated. 2 this step, 3 total
(gcd (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
     (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))

;; in if clause, (remainder (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) (remainder 206 40)) calculated. 4 this step, 7 total
(gcd (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
     (remainder (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
                (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                           (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))))

;; in if clause, (remainder (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))) calculasted. 7 this step, 14 total.
;; and finally, this value is 0!
(remainder (remainder 206 40)
           (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
```
So, remainder performed 18 times total.

# Applicative Order
```scheme
;; step 1
(gcd 206 40)

;; step 2
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(gcd 40 6)

;; step 3
(gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))
(gcd 6 4)

;; step 4
(gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))
(gcd 4 2)

;; step 5
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))
(gcd 2 0)

;; step 6
2
```
In each step, remainder operation in operand reduced immediately before evaluate "gcd" process. So remainder performed 4 times total in applicative order
