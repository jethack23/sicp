# Code
```scheme
#lang sicp

(define (double x)
  (+ x x))

(define (halve x)
  (/ x 2))

(define (fast-* a b)
  (cond ((= b 0) 0)
        ((even? b) (double (fast-* a (halve b))))
        (else (+ a (fast-* a (- b 1))))))
```
# Description
  Use same structure as fast-expt with small changes.
  - Return 0 instead of 1 when b is 0. Because in this case, you have to return identity element of that operation. 1 is multiplicative identity element. 0 is additive identity element.
  - Instead of `square`, use `double` in second case
  - Instead of `*`, use `+` in `else` clause.
