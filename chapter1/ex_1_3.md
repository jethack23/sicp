# My code
```scheme
(define (sum-of-squares-of-the-two-larger-numbers x y z)
  (- (sum-of-squares x y z) (square (min x y z))))

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares x y z)
  (+ (square x) (square y) (square z)))

(define (min x y z)
  (smaller (smaller x y) z))

(define (smaller x y)
  (if (< x y)
      x
      y))
```

# Description
I've chosen to calculate all sum of three squares and then from which subtract the square of the minimum of three.

To get minimum number of three, I've implemented `smaller` procedure and use it twice.
