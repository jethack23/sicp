(define (cbrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (/ (abs (- (cube guess) x)) x) 0.0001))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (double guess)) 3))

(define (cube x)

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (double x)

`(cbrt 8)` gives 2.000004911675504   
`(cbrt 27)` gives 3.0000005410641766   
I've improves `good-enough?` based on the flaw we discussed about in "Exercise 1.7" but in slightly different manner. It checks if the cube of our guess is close enough w.r.t. the fraction of x.
